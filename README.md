# Community health

**Contributor collaboration is a key indicator for the health of the application and its community/team.**

This tools was build to show key code and collaboration metrics for Github repositories. These metrics can help communities see trends, changes and outliers for their repository.

[Here](https://n07734.github.io/community-health/) you can generate metrics for any public repository or see metrics for popular repositories like React, TypeScript, Node, Deno etc.

### Random tech bits
There are no ifs in the code. Why? Because personal projects are good places to try things and I wanted to see what it would be like to write code without them, it was surprisingly easy. Just for the record I do not have anything against ifs, if you use them well.

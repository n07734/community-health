# What does good health look like?

This is a bit of a trick question as there are so many ways good and bad can look like.

These are general questions meant to help teams find useful data and promote healthy discussions around their contributions. Team context is needed to have a clear understanding of the data.


## PRs
*Are there any/enough comments? To few comments may be a sign that *the code is not getting fully reviewed.
*Are all PRs are being approved? If not then how do you know they are getting properly reviewed?
*Are there many large PRs? Generally the bigger the PR the lower the quality of the review will be.
*How are the trends changing during a feature lifecycle?
* What are the outliers and why?

# Contribution distribution
*Is there a healthy distribution of contributions across the team? Does not need to be even but should not be dependent on just a few people.
*What would happen if the top one or two contributors left or went on holiday?
*Are there enough people in team approving PRs? Only one or two people are doing this it can be a bottleneck.
*What are the outliers and why?

## Bugs
*What happens when there is a new release?
*Is the bug count raising? If so then why?

## User trends
*What is more discussed the "What"(PR comments) or the "How"(code comments)?
*Is there a healthy level of giving and receiving of comments and approvals?
*What are the outliers and why?
